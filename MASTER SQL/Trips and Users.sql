/*
Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests made by unbanned users (both client and 
driver must be unbanned) between Oct 1, 2013 and Oct 3, 2013. The cancellation rate is computed by 
dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests made by unbanned users by the total 
number of requests made by unbanned users.
